// OBJECT ARRAYS
//OOP-Object Oriented Programming example is Javascript. A language can be called OOP if
//it fulfills the 4 capacities

//A.  Encapsulation- bottling of data along with the methods that operrate on that data into a single unit
     // it can be used to  hide both data members and functions.

//B.  Aggregation- it is a specialized form of association between  
    // two or more objects in which each object has its own life cycle but there exist an ownership as well.

//C.  Inheritance- whereby an object can exhibit functionalities, 
    // abilities and instant variables of another object.

//D.   Polymorphism- whereby an object can take up many forms.
